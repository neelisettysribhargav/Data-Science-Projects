# Data Science Projects

This repository is a collection of short, self-contained data science projects implemented as Jupyter notebooks. Each project folder contains one or more notebooks, the datasets used for analysis, and a short project README describing goals, how to run the notebooks, and suggested next steps.

Projects
 - `Car-Price-Prediction` — Predict used car selling price using regression models.
 - `Fashion-Data-Analysis` — Exploratory analysis of fashion survey and historical data.
 - `Hotel-Booking-Analysis` — Analysis of hotel bookings and cancellations.
 - `Restaurant-Data-Analysis` — End-to-end exploration, feature engineering, and modeling for a restaurant dataset.
 - `Sentiment-Analysis` — NLP preprocessing and sentiment classification experiments.
 - `Web-Scraping` — Examples of web scraping and data collection pipelines.

How to use this repository

1. Open the project folder you want to explore (for example, `Car-Price-Prediction`).
2. Create a Python virtual environment and install dependencies (see the project's README for specifics).
3. Start Jupyter Lab/Notebook and run the notebooks top-to-bottom to reproduce analyses.

Recommended workflow

- Keep notebooks readable and well-documented. Run cells sequentially.
- Commit data-processing scripts and small utility modules alongside notebooks when possible.
- If you make structural changes, update the project's README with new instructions.
